Kria Technologies Limited 
Anti-Money Laundering (AML) Program: Compliance and Supervisory Procedures
----------------

### UPDATED AS OF 10TH OCTOBER, 2024
 
### 1. FIRM POLICY

### Anti-Money Laundering (AML) Policy

It is the policy of Kria Technologies Limited to prohibit and actively prevent money laundering and any activity that facilitates money laundering or the funding of terrorist or criminal activities. The company complies with all applicable requirements under the Money Laundering (Prohibition) Act, 2022, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) Anti-Money Laundering and Combating the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) Regulations, and other relevant Nigerian regulations.

Money laundering is generally defined as engaging in acts designed to conceal or disguise the true origins of criminally derived proceeds so that the proceeds appear to have derived from legitimate sources or constitute legitimate assets. Typically, money laundering occurs in three stages:

1. Placement: Criminally derived cash is introduced into the financial system, often through deposits, monetary instruments, or other means.
2. Layering: Funds are transferred or moved into other accounts, institutions, or jurisdictions to obscure their origin.
3. Integration: Laundered funds are reintroduced into the economy through the purchase of legitimate assets, business investments, or other financial activities.

While cash transactions are infrequent in digital financial solutions, fintech firms such as Kria Technologies are susceptible to being used for laundering funds acquired elsewhere or through fraudulent activities within the fintech ecosystem. Examples include unauthorized transactions, identity theft, cybercrime, and other digital fraud.

Terrorist financing may not necessarily involve proceeds of criminal conduct. It often aims to obscure the origin or intended use of funds, which could include funding illicit activities. Legitimate sources such as donations, business ownership, or personal employment may be exploited to finance terrorism. While the motives of terrorist financiers differ from those of traditional money launderers, the methods used often overlap. Financing terrorist activities may require minimal amounts of money, and such transactions might be small-scale or complex.

Kria Technologies’ AML policies, procedures, and internal controls are designed to ensure compliance with all applicable Nigerian regulations and guidelines, including those issued by the Special Control Unit Against Money Laundering (SCUML), the Nigerian Financial Intelligence Unit (NFIU), and the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN). These policies are regularly reviewed and updated to reflect changes in regulations, emerging risks, and the company’s business model.


### 2. AML COMPLIANCE PERSON DESIGNATION AND DUTIES

Kria Technologies Limited has designated <strong>Atunwa Vincent</strong> as its Anti-Money Laundering Program Compliance Person (AML Compliance Person), with full responsibility for the firm’s AML program. 

Vincent brings valuable experience from his tenure as a Resolution and Compliance Officer at GUO Logistics, where he gained foundational insights into compliance policies. Though his prior compliance experience pertains to logistics rather than financial services, he is committed to enhancing his expertise through professional certifications and continuous education as needed.

The duties of the AML Compliance Person include but are not limited to:
1. Monitoring Compliance: Ensuring the firm adheres to all relevant anti-money laundering (AML) obligations under Nigerian laws, such as the requirements outlined by  Control Unit Against Money Laundering (SCUML) and the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN).
2. Oversight of Transactions and Customer Databases: Regularly reviewing transaction histories and customer data via the Admin dashboard to identify, flag, and deactivate accounts involved in suspicious or unlawful activities.
3. Communication and Training: Providing employees with adequate training and guidance on AML policies and procedures, ensuring they remain aware of and compliant with their roles in detecting and preventing money laundering.
4. Record-Keeping: Maintaining comprehensive and organized records of customer transactions, flagged accounts, Suspicious Transaction Reports (STRs), and related documentation.
Records will be maintained using a combination of digital tools (e.g., the Admin dashboard) and software like Excel for tracking flagged accounts, compliance activities, and audit logs.

5. Reporting: Filing Suspicious Transaction Reports (STRs) or equivalent documentation as required by Nigerian regulators, such as SCUML and the Nigerian Financial Intelligence Unit (NFIU), and ensuring timely communication with these agencies.
   
The AML Compliance Person is vested with full authority and responsibility to enforce the firm’s AML program. In this capacity, Vincent will also ensure the program is reviewed and updated regularly to reflect changes in applicable regulations and the firm’s business activities.

5. Directing any questions about a request to the designated authority as specified in the request.

We will not disclose the existence or details of any request to unauthorized parties, except as necessary to fulfill the request. Kria Technologies will also implement robust measures to safeguard the security and confidentiality of such requests in compliance with applicable data protection laws.

### Voluntary Information Sharing With Financial Institutions:
 Under Nigerian law, Kria Technologies may share information with other financial institutions for the purpose of detecting and reporting activities related to money laundering, terrorist financing, or other financial crimes. Such information sharing will be conducted in line with relevant legal protections and confidentiality requirements.
 
### Procedures for Voluntary Information Sharing:

1. Prior to sharing information, Kria Technologies will:
* Verify the legitimacy of the receiving institution’s request.
* Obtain confirmation that the receiving institution is authorized to handle such information under Nigerian law.
* Ensure the institution has adequate measures to maintain the confidentiality of shared data.
  
2. All information sharing will be limited to the following purposes:

1. Users cannot directly top up a dollar wallet within the Kriapay platform.
2. Withdrawals or transfers to dollar accounts from the Kriapay platform are not supported.

### Procedures for Monitoring Currency Transactions:
1. Kria Technologies will monitor all currency swap activities for unusual or suspicious patterns that may indicate potential money laundering or fraudulent activity.
2. Any identified irregularities will be escalated to the AML Compliance Person, who will determine the need for further investigation or the filing of a Suspicious Activity Report (SAR).
3. Records of all currency transactions will be maintained in compliance with applicable recordkeeping requirements.

### Confidentiality and Recordkeeping:
All responses to government requests, voluntary information sharing activities, and records of currency transactions will be:
1. Segregated from other operational data to ensure confidentiality.
2. Retained securely for the legally required period.
3. Accessible only to authorized personnel with a need to know.

### Joint Compliance Reporting:
Where applicable, Kria Technologies may collaborate with partner financial institutions in reporting suspicious activities. Any such collaboration will be governed by strict confidentiality agreements and compliance with Nigerian legal requirements.


### 4. CHECKING THE OFFICE OF FOREIGN ASSETS CONTROL (OFAC) LISTINGS
Kria Technologies recognizes the importance of compliance with the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) regulations in conjunction with its Anti-Money Laundering (AML) compliance efforts. 

OFAC administers and enforces economic sanctions and embargoes aimed at safeguarding U.S. foreign policy and national security. These sanctions target specific geographic regions, governments, individuals, and entities, including international narcotics traffickers, foreign terrorists, and proliferators of weapons of mass destruction.

As part of its compliance measures, Kria Technologies will implement the following procedures:

### Pre-Account Opening Screening
Before opening an account, Kria Technologies will check to ensure that customers and transactions do not appear on the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons (SDN) List or involve prohibited activities under OFAC-administered economic sanctions and embargoes. 

This verification will include screening names against the SDN List and any other applicable sanctions lists using available tools, including OFAC’s Sanctions List Search tool.

### Ongoing Monitoring and Updates
The SDN List and related sanctions programs are updated frequently. Kria Technologies will:

1. Regularly consult the OFAC website for updates to the SDN List and sanctions programs.
2. Subscribe to receive real-time updates from OFAC.
3. Use compliance software to automate and ensure speed and accuracy in screening processes.
4. Review existing customer accounts and transactions against updated lists and document all reviews.
Handling Positive Matches and Prohibited Transactions
If a customer or transaction is identified as matching an entry on the SDN List or involves activities prohibited by OFAC:
Kria Technologies will immediately reject the transaction and/or block the customer’s assets.
A blocked assets and/or rejected transaction form will be filed with OFAC within 10 days of detection.
The OFAC Hotline at (800) 540-6322 will be contacted immediately for further guidance.
Scope of Review
The review process will include:
Screening customer accounts during onboarding and periodically afterward.
Monitoring transactions, including those that pass through Kria Technologies’ systems (e.g. deposits, currency swap or withdrawals).
Documentation and Reporting
All screenings, matches, and related actions will be documented. Required forms, including the Report of Blocked Transactions Form and Report of Rejected Transactions Form will be completed and submitted in accordance with OFAC regulations.
Training and Awareness
